# Why the Landing Page is Our MVP Right Now

The landing page is our MVP because it's the first and most critical touchpoint with potential users, and without a strong landing page, users won't discover or understand our product regardless of how feature-rich our backend is. The landing page is what visitors see first and determines whether they stay, sign up, or leave, making it our primary user acquisition engine that converts visitors into customers before they experience the full platform. It serves as a validation tool where we can test market demand, messaging, and pricing before building everything, with early feedback guiding product development. The landing page enables SEO, social sharing, and email collection as our marketing MVP that works 24/7, and every user journey starts at the landing page as the gateway to our platform's features. A polished landing page can be built faster than the full platform, providing immediate value while we continue backend development, and in a crowded market, a professional landing page signals quality and differentiates us from basic competitors. The landing page tests our deployment pipeline, hosting infrastructure, and tech stack before scaling, and landing pages are easy to A/B test and update so we can quickly optimize messaging, pricing, and features based on data. Our Feature-Rich MVP strategy requires a landing page that matches the quality of our platform since the landing page is the first feature users experience, and ultimately, the landing page is the bridge between "we're building something" and "here's what we built" because even with advanced backend features, without a strong landing page, users won't discover or understand our product, making it the marketing MVP, product showcase, and technical foundation all in one.
